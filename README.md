## Requirements

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Setup

To start a new project with this template:

1. Click [Use this template](https://github.com/PublicI/app-generator/generate).
2. Specify the repository's name and click "Create repository from template."
3. Wait for GitHub to generate a new repository.
4. Clone or open the repository by choosing on of the options under the "â†“ Code" button.
5. Open a terminal and navigate to the new repository's directory. Once in the project's directory, run `npx sao .`.
6. Answer a few questions and commit the result.

If you don't want to start with a GitHub repo, you could run `npx sao github:PublicI/app-generator <name-of-project>` in place of steps 1-6.

## Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
