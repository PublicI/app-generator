This is a generator for single-page apps and embeddable graphics for use by the Center for Public Integrity's news dev team. It sets things up real good so you don't have to worry about it none.

## Getting Started

First, install yo if you don't have yo:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

Then, to install this generator, run:

```bash
npm install -g github:publicintegrity/app-generator
```

If this gives you trouble, try [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/)

Finally, create a project directory and run the generator in it:

```bash
yo publici-app
```
