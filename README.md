This is a generator for single-page apps and embeddable graphics for use by the Center for Public Integrity's news dev team. It sets things up real good so you don't have to worry about it none.

## Getting started

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). If you don't have it, install it like:

```bash
yarn global add vue-cli
```

Then, to generate the project:

```bash
vue init PublicI/app-generator#nuxt <project-name>
cd <project-name> # move to your project
yarn
```

To use:
